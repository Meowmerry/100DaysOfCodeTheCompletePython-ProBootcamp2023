"""
Instructions
You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. 
The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 1 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

NOTE: Don't worry about getting hold of the input(), we've done the work behind the scenes to import everything.

HINT: Assume that names looks like this: input: x, y, z, names = ["x", "y", "z"]

Example Input
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

Example Output
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
Hints
You might need the help of the len() function.

Remember that Lists start at index 0!

#Given the code below:

fruits = ["Strawberries", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears"]

# What will be printed?

# What's going on?

# # This question combines several of the Python List concepts that weâ€™ve seen in the previous lessons in isolation. If the code above is at all confusing, I recommend breaking down whatâ€™s going on using several print statements using repl.it. First, try printing out:

print(dirty_dozen)
Then print out:

print(dirty_dozen[0])
print(dirty_dozen[1])
# To see what happens at the next stage print out:

print(dirty_dozen[1][2])
print(dirty_dozen[1][3])
# I hope this helps clarify how nested lists work. ðŸ™‚

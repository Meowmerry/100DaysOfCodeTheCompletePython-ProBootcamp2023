Day 6 : Function, Code Blocks and While Loops

welcome to Day 6 of 100 Days of code. And well done from making it this

far.

So today we're going to talk about code blocks and indentation as well as

functions and also a different flavor from the for loops that we saw yesterday.

Today

we're going to talk about while loops as well. And to learn all of these things,

we're going to use the help of something

that's very similar to Karel the robot.

And this is something I use when I first learnt how to code

and it's one of my favorite tools for learning programming

especially as we get into more difficult concepts like functions and while loops

et cetera. And by the end of the day, we're going to be writing the code

that's required to instruct our little robot to be able to complete any

randomly generated maze. So that's the goal

and if you head over to the next lesson,

let's get started and let's start learning about some of these things.

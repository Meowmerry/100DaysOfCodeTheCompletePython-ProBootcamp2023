# DAY 5 : For Loops, Range and Code Blocks

All right guys, well done for sticking it through.

You are now on day 5 of 100 Days of code.

And today I've got a fun project for you.

And the inspiration for the project comes from the fact that all sorts of

companies seem to be getting hacked these days. Everything from Ashley

Madison to Verizon,

everybody seems to be really bad at keeping your password safe.

So, how can we make sure that these hackers who are in hoodies and wearing face

masks, don't get to you and your account? I

don't know why hackers are always portrayed like this? I mean,

they're in their own house. They don't have to hide their face.

But at least they are conscious of not spreading germs and staying warm.

So that's good. But how do these hackers get into your account anyways?

Well,

one of the most common reasons is password reuse. Using the same password on 20

different sites from Google to Facebook, to Skype, to Spotify,

to all the random services that we sign up to.

The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked,

then the email and password combination you used to signup is compromised.

So all a hacker has to do is try out those credentials on a bunch of other

websites and see if they work. So how would you know,

if your email and password is on a database somewhere? You can head over to have

ibeenpwned.com, notice the spelling there,

and type in your email to see if it was involved in a website that had been

hacked.

So let's try an email here: elon@tesla.com

And it tells us, Oh, no, it seems like this email has been pwned.

And these where the websites which got hacked

potentially leaking this email and it's associated password.

I actually recommend you to try out your own email addresses right now and see

which services you signed up to have been compromised.

But if you want better security,

then you'll actually need unique passwords for each and every website.

And they should really be strong passwords, not 12345

6, or qwerty. If I just called out your password,

please change it.

Now what we're going to be building is exactly that. We're going to be building a

password generator,

something that's going to generate strong passwords with letters and symbols and

numbers. First, they ask us how many letters would you like in your password?

I would like 12. How many symbols would you like? I would like 2.

And I would also like 2 numbers in my password.

And then I hit enter and it gives me the password that it has generated with two

symbols, two numbers and 12 letters.

So that's a pretty strong looking password

if you asked me. Now I can use this and update my passwords to something very

strong and very secure.

So this is what we'll be building by the end of today. But in order to do it,

we first need to learn some new skills and new concepts.

So head over to the next lesson and let's get started.
